# Autonomous Drone Racing - Gate Recognition Development
These files were developed as part of Lockheed Martin's AlphaPilot Challenge.  The following paper was written and published as a result of this work:

Note: The files are loaded here to show the process.  Training images were provided by the challenge  and are not loaded here.
